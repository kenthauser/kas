Opcode Notes: 1/23/2017


1. Consider keeping (pointer to) 1 instance of each opcode type map.

2. Use this instance to evaluate during relax/emit phases.

3. Use copy ctor during parse. (name construct? or can you take address
   of std copy ctor?)

4. During parse: can get bsd_opcode ".text" which translates to
   core_opcode "SEG". During parse, need "get_opcode" to return
   bsd_opcode (which .text populated). During relax/emit, only need
   base opcode (SEG) instance.

5. create an "opcode" inserter:
        - dereference yields reference to back()
        - if (is_error()), doesn't insert. XXX observe use cases.

6. refactor chunk_inserter/iterator to init from inserter/iterator
