Relocation notes:

1. Define `actions` in kbfd. 

Action is operation function set (such as ADD, SUB, ARM_REL_MOVW).
Defined in arch file (eg kbfd/target/arm.h, kbfd/target/i386.h, etc.)
Defined as KAS_STRING types.
Added to `all_defns` list specialized with arch name.



2. Define `kbfd_reloc` as Action + Width + Flags (Relative, Thread-local, etc)

Action is index in `all_reloc_ops` list: start with 8-bits
Width is converted to 3-bit field of flags for supported widths
Or'd with additional flags: 8-bits

3. Need to add `get_reloc_info(kbfd_obj const&, kbfd_reloc const&)` to
return `kbfd_reloc_info`. Must lookup reloc in `kas_core` so that listing
and object can generate same info. Matches current `kbfd emit` interface.
