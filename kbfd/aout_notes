a.out symbols:

a.out symbols use `n_type` to define section. Defined sections are
        N_UNDEF 0
        N_ABS   2
        N_TEXT  4
        N_DATA  6
        N_BSS   8
        N_COMM  0x12
        N_FN    0x1f    // file name of .o

        // others for weak symbols. can derive from above

Currently `kbfd_section_sym::generate_symtab(obj&)` converts host -> obj 
symbol table. However, need mapping from `section` to `N_*`
